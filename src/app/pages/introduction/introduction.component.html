                <p class="description">Kage-UI is a thoughtfully designed Angular UI component library focused on modern, minimalistic, and border-centric design aesthetics. It empowers developers to build consistent and elegant user interfaces while maintaining full control over styling through SCSS customization. Every component in Kage-UI is built with modularity in mind, allowing you to use only what you need without bloating your application.</p>
                <p class="description">Using Kage-UI components ensures a streamlined and uniform design language across your application. The components follow accessibility best practices and provide responsive layouts by default, making them suitable for both desktop and mobile applications. Whether you're building internal tools or polished consumer-facing products, Kage-UI offers components like buttons, cards, modals, forms, alerts, and tabsâ€”all styled with a distinctive bordered approach.</p>
                <p class="description">A key advantage of Kage-UI lies in its adaptability. The design system is powered by a themable SCSS structure, giving developers the flexibility to define global variables for colors, borders, spacing, and more. This allows seamless integration with custom design systems or branding requirements without overriding core styles.</p>
                <p class="description">Kage-UI also encourages consistency in interaction and appearance. Inputs, buttons, and layout elements are built to work together cohesively, reducing the need for redundant styling and repeated logic. The focus on clean APIs and intuitive property bindings ensures that developers spend less time configuring UI and more time delivering functionality.</p>
                <p class="description">Ideal for Angular teams who value performance, simplicity, and customization, Kage-UI offers a practical and scalable solution to building beautiful UIs. Whether you're starting a new project or integrating into an existing one, using Kage-UI components brings structure, flexibility, and visual harmony to your development workflow.</p>
